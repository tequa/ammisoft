Short Guide for AMMISOFT Data Files:

The first line of a data file contains two items.
    (1) Columns 1–72, title for the dataset.
    (2) Columns 77–80, brief name for the dataset.

The second line contains thirteen items.
    (1) Columns 1–20, name for the data’s measurement and units.
    (2) Columns 21–25 right justified, scaling integer N, multiplies data by 10**N.
    (3) Columns 26–30 right justified, number of genotypes.
    (4) Columns 32–35 left justified, name for genotypes (such as GEN).
    (5) Columns 36–40 right justified, number of environments.
    (6) Columns 42–45 left justified, name for environments (such as ENV).
    (7) Columns 46–50 right justified, number of replications.
    (8) Columns 52–55 left justified, name for replications (such as REP).
    (9) Columns 58–60, order of data entries, specified by the first letters of the names
          from columns 32, 42, and 52; the first changing fastest and the last changing slowest.
    (10) Columns 62–65 left justified, name for treatments (such as TRT).
    (11) Columns 68–70 left justified, experimental design (RCB or other such as RAN).
    (12) Columns 71–75 right justified or with decimal point, missing value indicator.
    (13) Column 80, if N, no format supplied; if F, format supplied for reading data.

Optional format line if F in column 80 of line 2, the FORTRAN format up to 72 characters.

The data entries, in free format if no format is supplied; in fixed format if format is supplied.

Genotype code names and then environment code names in format 15(A4, 1X),
with each list starting a new line.
